# `peer mst` — operator commands for MST anchoring

The `peer mst` command group talks to the MST anchor-status system chaincode
(`mstscc`), a channel's MST configuration, the per-channel MST contract, and the
local relayer. It wraps what you would otherwise do with raw
`peer chaincode query -n mstscc …` calls and config-block fetches.

All commands take `-C/--channelID` and, optionally, `--peerAddresses` /
`--tlsRootCertFiles` (default: the local peer from `core.yaml`). Commands that
read the MST chain also accept `--rpc` (default: `mst.evm.rpcURL`).

## Query the anchor-status ledger fact (`mstscc`)

```bash
# Full status record for one transaction
peer mst status <txid> -C mychannel
#   fabric tx id : <txid>
#   anchor ref   : 0x… (the MST tx hash)
#   status       : CONFIRMED
#   recorded at  : 2026-07-18T… (unix)

# Quick boolean
peer mst is-anchored <txid> -C mychannel      # -> true / false

# Enumerate / count anchored transactions on the channel
peer mst list -C mychannel [--limit 50] [--json]
peer mst count -C mychannel                    # -> a number
```

`--json` emits the raw chaincode payload for `status`/`list`/`channel-config`.

## Inspect the channel's agreed MST policy

```bash
peer mst channel-config -C mychannel
#   enabled           : true
#   contract address  : 0x…
#   chain id          : 1337
#   capture mode      : opt-in (default)
#   batch strategy    : individual (default)
#   confirmations     : 1
#   cadence           : per-tx
```

Reads the channel configuration (via `cscc GetChannelConfig`), i.e. the value
all orgs agreed on — not any single peer's `core.yaml`.

## Verify a transaction end-to-end

```bash
peer mst verify <txid> -C mychannel
#   commitment        : 0x…
#   fabric ledger fact: recorded (ref 0x…)
#   on-chain anchor   : commitment 0x…, block N
#   MATCH
```

`verify` fetches the transaction from the ledger, recomputes its commitment,
reads the anchor from the channel's contract, and reports **MATCH**/**NO-MATCH**
— and whether the anchor status is recorded on Fabric. Exit code: `0` = MATCH,
`1` = NO-MATCH / not anchored. Opted-in transactions verify against their
declared payload; anchor-all transactions against the empty canonical payload.

## Read the MST contract directly

```bash
peer mst onchain <txid> -C mychannel
#   contract    : 0x…
#   commitment  : 0x…
#   block number: N
#   evm time    : …
```

Bypasses Fabric and calls `getAnchor` on the channel's contract.

## Preflight a channel's MST config against the live chain

```bash
peer mst preflight -C mychannel --rpc http://mst-node:8545
#   channel: mychannel
#   [PASS] enabled       MST anchoring is enabled
#   [PASS] rpc endpoint   connected; node reports chain id 1337
#   [PASS] chain id       config chainID 1337 matches the node
#   [PASS] contract       0x… responds as an MSTAnchor contract
#   [PASS] nodeous        all 2 application org(s) have NodeOUs peer classification
#
#   preflight: OK
```

Run this **before** applying an `MSTAnchor` config update. It reads the channel's
current MST config and checks it against the live chain: the node is reachable,
its chain id matches the configured `ChainID` (a `ChainID` of 0 is reported as a
WARN — unpinned, not a failure), the configured contract address actually hosts a
compatible MSTAnchor contract (probed via `getAnchor`, so it catches both an
undeployed address and a wrong/incompatible ABI), and the channel's MSPs have
**NodeOUs** peer classification enabled (required for the write-back peer-role
gate — see [`PHASE-1.5.md`](PHASE-1.5.md)). The NodeOUs check is a WARN if only
some orgs lack it, a FAIL if none have it (write-back could never land). Exits
non-zero if any check FAILs, so it fits a CI/pre-apply gate. `--json` emits the
structured result. On a disabled channel it reports "nothing to preflight" and
exits 0.

This complements the always-on structural validation in `channelconfig`
(`common/channelconfig/mstanchor.go`), which rejects a zero contract address and
inconsistent cadence at config-apply time but cannot make network calls.

## Check the local relayer

```bash
peer mst pipeline
#   relayer      : ok
#   channel mychannel
#     mst_outbox_entries{status="PENDING"} 0
#     mst_outbox_entries{status="DONE"} 42
#   relayer account
#     mst_relayer_balance_gwei …
```

Reads this peer's relayer metrics endpoint (`mst.metricsAddr` in `core.yaml`).
Requires the MST metrics endpoint to be enabled.

## Manage the contract's relayer allowlist (owner only)

```bash
# Requires the contract owner's EVM key in MST_OWNER_KEY (or MST_RELAYER_KEY)
export MST_OWNER_KEY=0x<owner-private-key>
peer mst relayer add    0x<wallet> -C mychannel
peer mst relayer remove 0x<wallet> -C mychannel
```

Calls `setRelayer` on the channel's contract to add/remove a wallet from its
relayer allowlist. Only has an effect if the contract was deployed with the
allowlist enabled. See [`PHASE-1.5.md`](PHASE-1.5.md) for the allowlist model.

## Notes

- `status`/`is-anchored`/`list`/`count`/`channel-config` need only a running,
  reachable peer — no MST RPC access.
- `verify`/`onchain`/`preflight`/`relayer` additionally reach the MST chain
  (`--rpc` or `mst.evm.rpcURL`); reads use a throwaway key, only `relayer` signs
  (owner key).
- These are convenience wrappers; the underlying calls remain available via
  `peer chaincode query -n mstscc` and the standalone `mst-verify` tool.

## Test coverage

MST anchoring is covered by layered automated tests; no single suite spins up a
full live network, so the layers below together cover every component:

| Layer | Where | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| Channel-config value | `common/channelconfig/mstanchor_test.go` | parse/validate/round-trip of the `MSTAnchor` config value, incl. zero-address and cadence-consistency rejection |
| System chaincode | `core/scc/mstscc/mstscc_test.go` | record/query/idempotency, list/count, channel-enablement gating |
| Simulated pipeline e2e | `internal/pkg/mstanchor/e2e_test.go` | real capture → outbox → sender → `mstscc` write-back with in-memory MST + channel-config gating + per-channel isolation |
| EVM contract (Go) | `mst/relay/evm/integration_test.go` | real chain: anchor/get/root/sender pipeline **and the relayer allowlist `setRelayer` path** (env-gated on `MST_EVM_RPC`; runs in CI's hardhat job) |
| EVM contract (Solidity) | `mst/anchor-contracts/test/MSTAnchor.test.ts` | contract semantics incl. allowlist, run by hardhat in CI |
| `peer mst` commands | `internal/peer/mst/*_test.go` | each command's proposal construction, output, and error paths (fake endorser + test MSP); helpers and metrics rendering |

The **full live-network run** (real peers + orderer + a live EVM node in one
process) is the documented manual walkthrough in
[`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md) — including the `peer mst` commands and,
for an allowlisted contract, `peer mst relayer add <addr>`.
